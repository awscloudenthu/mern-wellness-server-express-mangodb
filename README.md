# mern-wellness-server-express-mangodb

This project creates an API using an Express server, sets up MongoDB on the fly, and seeds data for POC purposes.
It uses Docker Compose to containerize the Express and MongoDB services, making deployment and management easy.
All CRUD operations for managing data are functional.
I have deployed this API on AWS EC2, and it is currently being consumed by a web application accessible at : https://renewedpathway.org/
